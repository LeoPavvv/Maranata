# Maranata
Console game made in Python

This is a Turn-Based Role-Playing Game in which there are 9 different characters to choose from and battle against each other. It includes PvE, PvP, and a mode that simulates a dungeon where you encounter various creatures and engage in battles against them. The characters have unique attributes, and there are health and strength potions to be used in combat. It was one of the first things I did when I started around 2021-2022
